'Results' tab
-------------

The 'Results' tab contains all results produced by the calculation codes. When a project is loaded into I-Simpa the outcome data are organized as a tree structure that exactly correspond to the folder/files tree on the hard disk (*i.e.* the *physical* tree). It is possible to directly access to the contents of a folder from the associated contextual menu, by choosing the 'Open folder' option. If changes are made in the *physical* tree, it is possible to refresh the results true by setting the action 'Refresh folder'.

.. warning::
	Deleting a folder or a file from the I-Simpa interface or from an extern file explorer is definitive.

The results of the calculations are sequentially added to the 'Results' tree with a folder name that is automatically generated from the date of the calculation (the name can be modified by the user). For each calculation, two XML files are automatically added to the results folder:

- the `config.xml` file is generated by I-Simpa and contains all the information that are needed for the calculation (according to the calculation code used).

- the `projet_config.xml` file contains all information in the 3 tabs 'Scene', 'Calculation' and 'Results'. This file can be used as a 'memory' of the calculation (archive).

In addition, each calculation codes generates specific files that can be interpreted by I-Simpa, depending of their format (with specific contents and file extensions).

For more information, see the 'Results' section of each calculation code (in the documentation):

File formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I-Simpa can interpret two types of file:

- **File formats recognized by the Operating System**, such as `txt`, `xml`, `html`, `pdf`... for example. Double left click on the file starts the  associated program within the operating system.

- **Native I-Simpa files**: these file are created by the calculation code and that can be associated with specific actions and treatments within I-Simpa.
