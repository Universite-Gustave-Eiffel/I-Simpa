I-Simpa is a `new generation of noise prediction software for research, engineering and education`_. I-Simpa is a graphical user interface (GUI) developed to host three-dimensional numerical codes for the modeling of sound propagation in complex geometrical domains, and propose many `features`_
Although I-Simpa is well adapted for energetic models (ray-tracing, sound-particle tracing, theory of reverberation…), it can be extend to use ondulatory approaches.

I-Simpa User Guide
==================

This is the **official I-Simpa User Guide**, including the SPPS and
the TCR numerical codes (embedded within the I-Simpa software).

-  for **more information** on I-Simpa, `visit the offical I-Simpa
   website`_
-  for **contributing to I-Simpa** from the source code, follows the
   `instructions`_
-  for **contacting the development team** uses the email:
   i-simpa@ifsttar.fr


.. important::
   - The guide is currently not complete. Additions are underway.
