The simulation code TCR (from French "Théorie Classique de la Réverbération") is a numerical application of the Classical
Theory of Reverberation as proposed by Sabine. It allows to obtain an evaluation of the diffuse sound field in a single
room on the basis of Sabine's relations for the reverberation time and for the sound level of the reverberated field.
